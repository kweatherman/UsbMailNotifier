# UsbMailNotifier

###### Python code to control the "Mail Notifier" USB HID LED device.

Requires the [pyusb](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb) and [libusb](https://pypi.org/project/libusb/) modules.
Developed with w/Python 3.8 on Windows 10 64bit host.

Attempted to get this working on Ubuntu 20, but it has a lot of issues to be resolved about Kernel device ownership.
This one did work on an older Ubuntu and libsub version:
